### Overview
For this project, I decided to make an endless runner game using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). Mobile services for data storage/retrieval were a requirement in the project guidelines, and I thought the best way to incorporate saving data would be high scores within a game.  

### Initial Ideas
There are countless endless runner games available online, with some of the most popular being [Temple Run](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/temple-run/9wzdncrfj3w3?SilentAuth=1&wa=wsignin1.0), Facebook's [Endless Lake](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spilgames.EndlessLake&hl=en), and the infamous [Flappy Bird](http://flappybird.io/). Endless runner games are, in my opinion, so popular because they're simple and easy to play - and also because you'll always want to one-up your friends' scores.  
It seems like every possible idea has already been done (see [Flappy Jam](https://itch.io/jam/flappyjam) games) but I came up with the following list of ideas:  
1. Tip Tap Swim: An endless underwater scroller feautring a character (a manta ray or a turtle, still deciding) and some obstacles (seaweed, coral, other sea creatures). Scoring: either each obstacle passed adds 1 to your score, or score based on time without hitting an object.
2. Tappy Toaster: A nod to After Dark's popular [Flying Toasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Dark_(software)#Flying_Toasters) screensaver from the 1990s. Similar gameplay - tap the toaster to make it fly higher or lower, dodging objects. Scoring based on either obstacles avoided or time without hitting something.
