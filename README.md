### Overview
For this project, I decided to make an endless runner game using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). The goal of the game is to avoid the rain clouds and beat your high score.

### Initial Ideas
There are countless endless runner games available online, with some of the most popular being [Temple Run](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/temple-run/9wzdncrfj3w3?SilentAuth=1&wa=wsignin1.0), Facebook's [Endless Lake](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spilgames.EndlessLake&hl=en), and the infamous [Flappy Bird](http://flappybird.io/). Endless runner games are, in my opinion, so popular because they're simple and easy to play - and also because you'll always want to one-up your friends' scores.  
It seems like every possible idea has already been done (see [Flappy Jam](https://itch.io/jam/flappyjam) games) but I came up with the following list of ideas:  
1. Tip Tap Swim: An endless underwater scroller feautring a character (a manta ray or a turtle, still deciding) and some obstacles (seaweed, coral, other sea creatures). Scoring: either each obstacle passed adds 1 to your score, or score based on time without hitting an object.
2. Tappy Toaster: A nod to After Dark's popular [Flying Toasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Dark_(software)#Flying_Toasters) screensaver from the 1990s. Similar gameplay - tap the toaster to make it fly higher or lower, dodging objects. Scoring based on either obstacles avoided or time without hitting something.  

In the end, I decided to go for Tappy Toaster as the theme seemed a bit more interesting / light hearted and hasn't been done before.

### User Guide
1. Download the game from the Microsoft App Store (submitted, will link when published).  
2. Open the game and click start.  
3. When you're ready, start the game using the spacebar, left mouse button, or tap the screen. These controls can be used to give the toaster a boost. Avoid the clouds and aim for a new high score!  
4. If you hit a cloud, the game will restart automatically. Space / tap / click to start the game again. 

**Scoring**  
The game is time based - for every second you last without hitting a cloud, you'll gain two points.

### Learning Curve  
I had never worked with Unity before, but wanted to try developing a simple, fun game. I found Unity was very finicky at times and it took a while to get used to, but ultimately was enjoyable to play around with. There were many useful tutorials online, as well as many forums and good documentation.   
I tried various cloud storage functions from Azure, but found it very difficult to incorporate in the app.  [ Still workin on it, will update later ]
